# SQL train

People wanna live in this wishful thinking reality where like they can work 5 hours a day and also think that they are the best programmers in the world and that just not how it works.

They shame people who work the hardest but also think that they deserve more respect from them.

Working hard is good. I work hard for myself.

Just a dude, who tries really hard...

There's a huge difference between passive learning which you can do while working, and active learning where you do something uncomfortable that would normally be busting brain to improve a certain skillset.

"People seem to understand that if you want to be in the olympics and to be an olympic class athlete you have to train heavily, people understand that, but they somehow don't understand that the same thing is true for other descipline."

If you wanna be an worldclass olympic programmer, you have to put in the training, that should be obvious right? And it is not for some people.

Someone saying that you can like what you do and still wanna clock out at 5, that is fine, totally cool if you enjoy working 9-5 and got some stuff done and go to movies, not objecting to that life choice but just realize
